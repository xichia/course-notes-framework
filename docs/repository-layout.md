# Repository Layout

This repository uses a **one-workspace workflow**. The outer Git repository has one public
history and tracks the framework plus public-safe content. The ignored `private/` directory may
live inside that workspace, but its contents are not part of the outer repository, its history,
its remote, or its clones.

## What is tracked

Git tracks the framework — scripts, templates, prompts, docs, metadata schema,
validation logic, generated-file conventions — plus the `courses/` tree.
Everything under `courses/` must be safe to publish: it is what the GitHub remote
ever exposes. `make validate-public` scans only `courses/` and fails on
`visibility: private`, course-derived or unknown `source-risk`, missing
publication classifications, and local paths.

## What is not tracked

The entire `private/` directory is ignored by Git (see the `private/` rule in
[../.gitignore](../.gitignore)). It is local working storage only:

- `private/courses/` mirrors the `courses/` layout for private notes. A private
  note keeps `visibility: private` and an honest `source-risk`; it may
  intentionally fail `make validate-public`, but that gate never scans it.
  Some courses additionally keep an `admin/announcements/` subfolder with LMS
  announcement captures, and an `lms-import/` subfolder with captured pages,
  downloaded materials, and the inventories that track them. See
  [`prompts/sync-lms-course-content.md`](../prompts/sync-lms-course-content.md)
  for the full sync workflow and
  [`prompts/sync-lms-announcements.md`](../prompts/sync-lms-announcements.md)
  for the announcement conventions in detail.
- `private/raw/` holds raw source material (slides, handouts, transcripts, LMS
  exports) that must never be committed.
- `private/drafts/` holds work in progress.
- `private/framework-feedback.md` holds scratch notes about the framework itself.

Because `private/` is Git-ignored by the outer repository, it is never committed or pushed by
that repository and receives no history or backup from it.
Keeping material there is **not** sanitization: promoting a private note into
`courses/` requires an explicit sanitization and review step (see
[publication policy](publication-policy.md) and the
[public release checklist](public-release-checklist.md)).

## Working in this layout

- Add and study real notes under `private/courses/<course>/...` while their
  provenance or publication status is uncertain.
- **Study commands** mirror the public targets but operate on `private/courses/`:

  | Command | Purpose |
  |---|---|
  | `make study-validate` | Validate notes under `private/courses/` |
  | `make study-manifest` | Build `private/manifest.json` from study notes |
  | `make study-review` | Build `private/REVIEW_QUEUE.md` from study notes |
  | `make study-all` | Run study-validate, study-manifest, and study-review |
  | `make study-reviewed NOTE=<id>` | Mark a study note as reviewed |

- The public `make manifest`, `make review`, and `make validate` still operate on
  `courses/` only. Private notes never leak into the public generated files.
- To publish a note, sanitize it into a `courses/<course>/` file with an allowed
  `visibility` and `source-risk`, then run the canonical `make public-safety` gate.
- `make pre-release` is a convenience target that runs that gate and rebuilds the
  public generated files.
- `private/` is deliberately untracked by the outer repository: back it up independently. An
  optional nested private Git repository is a separate advanced arrangement, described in
  [Adopting the framework](adopting-the-framework.md).
