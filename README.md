# Course Notes

A Markdown-first system for durable learning notes, selective LLM retrieval, review queues, and study workflows. Markdown files under `courses/` are the source of truth; the manifest and review queue are generated views.

> One repository, one working copy. Tracked content (`courses/` plus the framework) is the public-safe surface pushed to the GitHub remote; raw or source-risky material lives under a Git-ignored `private/` directory and is never committed.
>
> License: MIT. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). The scripts, templates, prompts, and documentation are MIT licensed. Real course-derived notes should not be published through this repository unless separately cleared.

## Quickstart

For a human overview, open [INDEX.md](INDEX.md). For an LLM session, provide [LLM_GUIDE.md](LLM_GUIDE.md) and [manifest.json](manifest.json) first. For today's study priorities, open [REVIEW_QUEUE.md](REVIEW_QUEUE.md).

After adding or changing notes, run the normal workflow:

```bash
make all
```

This validates notes, rebuilds generated files, and runs tests.  For the
complete one-folder workflow (including private-study commands and the
pre-commit safety gate), see
[docs/operating-checklist.md](docs/operating-checklist.md). If Make is unavailable, use the direct commands:

```bash
python3 validate_notes.py
python3 build_manifest.py
python3 build_review_queue.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Individual Make targets are also available:

```bash
make validate
make manifest
make review
make test
make all
```

Make is only a convenience; the scripts require Python 3, use only the standard library, and remain directly runnable.

## Public/private content policy

The publishable work in this repository is original study material, not reproduced lecture material. Both public and private material live in this **single** repository, separated by directory and Git tracking rather than by repository:

| Public Course Notes material (tracked, pushed) | Private by default (`private/`, Git-ignored) |
|---|---|
| Templates, scripts, prompts, docs, metadata schemas, validation logic, generated-file conventions, and synthetic examples | Real lecture-derived notes, problem sheets, exam maps/questions, lecturer hints, LMS material, assessment material, personal study evidence, and course-specific examples |

- **`courses/`** holds only public-safe, polished notes. It is tracked by Git and must pass `make validate-public`. This is the only course tree the GitHub remote ever sees.
- **`private/`** holds everything source-risky or not yet cleared: private course notes under `private/courses/`, raw source material under `private/raw/`, drafts under `private/drafts/`, and `private/framework-feedback.md`. The whole `private/` tree is ignored by Git (see [.gitignore](.gitignore)) and is never committed or pushed. It stays local to your working copy.

AI summarizing or paraphrasing alone does not make protected course material safe to publish. Keeping a file under `private/` is not sanitization; promoting a private note into `courses/` requires a separate sanitization and review step.

Read [docs/publication-policy.md](docs/publication-policy.md) before changing visibility or preparing a release, and use [docs/public-release-checklist.md](docs/public-release-checklist.md) before promoting any private note into `courses/`.

`make validate-public` applies the same conservative gate as before: it scans only `courses/` and fails on `visibility: private`, course-derived or unknown `source-risk`, missing publication classifications, and local paths. The gate is not weakened by the `private/` directory — `private/` is simply outside its scan scope.

### Public vs private notes

This repository is both the study workspace and the public Course Notes release. Tooling, templates, prompts, documentation, validation logic, and synthetic/demo content are tracked; real course notes and raw source material are kept under the Git-ignored `private/` directory.

A note is private by default (`visibility: private`) and its first or working copy belongs under `private/courses/`. It may intentionally fail `make validate-public`, because that gate only ever runs against `courses/`. A note may move into `courses/` only after it has been sanitized to `public-framework` / `public-original` / `public-open-licensed` with an allowed `source-risk` and has passed `make public-safety`.

The included `courses/demo-course/` tree is fictional and exists only to demonstrate the system; replace it with other synthetic material—not real course notes—when preparing a public variant. The `private/` directory is ignored by Git: it exists for your local working material and is not part of the public release.

## Source of Truth and Generated Files

- Markdown under `courses/` is the source of truth for course knowledge, evidence, and review metadata.
- `manifest.json` is a generated retrieval index. Its top-level `_generated` field says how to rebuild it.
- `REVIEW_QUEUE.md` is a generated study-priority view and begins with a generated-file warning.
- `INDEX.md` and course `README.md` files are maintained human navigation.
- Files under `prompts/` are reusable instructions, not course facts.

Never edit `manifest.json` or `REVIEW_QUEUE.md` manually. Update source Markdown and run `make manifest`, `make review`, or `make all`.

**Determinism:** Generated files use a date-only `generated-at` field (no time). Running `make all` multiple times on the same day produces no diff when notes are unchanged. For fully reproducible builds, set the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable (Unix timestamp) or pass `--today` to `build_review_queue.py`.

## Command Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `make validate` | Check metadata, IDs, dates, links, required sections, and mistake structure |
| `make validate-public` | Apply the stricter public-release gate to `courses/` only; private notes under `private/` are outside its scope. Loads `.public-release-blocklist` if present (see below) |
| `make manifest` | Validate and rebuild `manifest.json` |
| `make review` | Validate and rebuild `REVIEW_QUEUE.md` for today; set `DATE=YYYY-MM-DD` for a reproducible date |
| `make test` | Run the dependency-free regression suite |
| `make pre-release` | Convenience release rebuild: run `make public-safety`, then regenerate public generated files |
| `make all` | Run normal validation, both generators, and all tests |
| `make reviewed NOTE=layered-recall` | Update `last-reviewed` and `review-after` for a note by ID (see below) |
| `make reviewed NOTE=layered-recall DATE=2026-07-15` | As above, using a specific review date |
| `python3 build_review_queue.py --today YYYY-MM-DD` | Generate the review queue for a specific date |
| `make study-validate` | Validate notes under `private/courses/` |
| `make study-manifest` | Build `private/manifest.json` from study notes |
| `make study-review` | Build `private/REVIEW_QUEUE.md` from study notes |
| `make study-all` | Run study-validate, study-manifest, and study-review |
| `make study-reviewed NOTE=<id>` | Mark a study note under `private/courses/` as reviewed |
| `make public-safety` | Canonical publication-safety gate: check Git boundaries and tracked/staged leaks, validate the public tree, and run all tests |

The equivalent direct Python commands are shown in Quickstart. Append `--study` to any tool to target `private/courses/` instead of `courses/`.

CI runs on every push and pull request: the canonical `make public-safety` gate, a rebuild of public generated files, and a generated-file staleness check. See [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml). Remote CI can ratify a change only after it is pushed.

### Optional blocklist

Create `.public-release-blocklist` in the repository root with one term per line to extend `make validate-public`. This local-only file is ignored by Git by default; do not commit it. Lines starting with `#` and blank lines are ignored. Matching is case-insensitive.

```text
# Lines starting with # are comments.
Example University
PROFESSOR NAME
canvas.example.edu
MATH123
```

When present, `make validate-public` scans all Markdown files for these terms and reports each match as an error. This is a safety smoke alarm — it does not replace manual review. Remove or replace any blocked terms before publishing.

### Mark a note as reviewed

After studying a note, update its review metadata with:

```bash
make reviewed NOTE=layered-recall
```

Or with a specific date:

```bash
make reviewed NOTE=layered-recall DATE=2026-07-15
```

The script updates only `last-reviewed` and `review-after`. It does not change `status`, `visibility`, `source-risk`, or any other frontmatter. The next review date is chosen from the current status:

| Status | Next review |
|---|---|
| `new` | +1 day |
| `shaky` | +2 days |
| `learning` | +7 days |
| `solid` | +30 days |
| `mastered` | +60 days |
| `reference` / `archived` | blank |

Run `make all` after the update to regenerate the manifest and review queue.

## Adding a new course

The full copy-and-check workflow is in [docs/course-onboarding.md](docs/course-onboarding.md). In short:

1. Create `private/courses/<course-code>/` with `concepts/`, `lectures/`, `problem-sheets/`, and `exam/`.
2. Copy `templates/course.md` to `private/courses/<course-code>/course.md` and replace every placeholder.
3. Copy `templates/syllabus.md` to `private/courses/<course-code>/syllabus.md`; add only official or explicitly sourced material.
4. Copy `templates/lecture.md` into `private/courses/<course-code>/lectures/` for each raw chronological lecture record.
5. Use `prompts/import-lecture.md` to propose durable concept extraction, then create approved concepts from `TEMPLATE.md`.
6. Put attempts, corrections, and evidenced mistakes under `private/courses/<course-code>/problem-sheets/`.
7. Put confirmed exam information and outcome maps under `private/courses/<course-code>/exam/`.
8. Run `make study-validate`.
9. Run `make study-manifest`, `make study-review`, and `make test` (or `make study-all` followed by `make test`).

`courses/` is not the onboarding destination for real material. Use it only when a sanitized public candidate is ready for the separate publication workflow.

Set every document's `course` field to the exact directory name. Keep raw lecture notes intact, preserve source paths, and keep missing official information visibly unknown.

After the first import, run the ten-minute [course import friction test](docs/friction-test.md).

## Add a Concept Note

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to `private/courses/<course-code>/concepts/readable-filename.md`.
2. Give it a repository-unique, permanent `id`. For new notes, `<course-code>-<concept-slug>` is a useful convention.
3. Fill in every metadata field and write the note in your own words.
4. Use note IDs, not filenames, in `prerequisites` and `related`.
5. Validate, then regenerate the manifest and review queue.

Keep filenames readable and stable. A concept note should grow as understanding improves instead of being replaced by dated copies.

## Daily Study

1. Run `make review` (or `python3 build_review_queue.py`).
2. Open `REVIEW_QUEUE.md`, or give `prompts/daily-study.md` to an LLM with repository access.
3. Study the highest-priority item through active recall before rereading it.
4. Update review dates and Mistake Log items only after checking your performance. Use `make reviewed NOTE=<id>` to update dates quickly.
5. Run `make all` after changing source notes.

For a weekly planning session, run `make all`, then use `prompts/weekly-review.md` with the refreshed manifest and queue.

## Metadata Contract

Every study document under `courses/` (except navigational `README.md` files) uses the same frontmatter keys:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Permanent, repository-unique identifier; lowercase letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens |
| `title` | Human title, matching the document's `#` heading |
| `course` | Course directory name |
| `type` | `concept`, `lecture`, `problem-sheet`, `exam-map`, `glossary`, or `reference` |
| `topic` | Stable topic slug within the course |
| `aliases` | Alternative search terms as an inline list |
| `prerequisites` | Note IDs needed first |
| `related` | Other relevant note IDs |
| `exam-weight` | `none`, `low`, `medium`, or `high` |
| `status` | `new`, `learning`, `shaky`, `solid`, `mastered`, `reference`, or `archived` |
| `last-reviewed` | Last active-recall date as `YYYY-MM-DD`, or blank |
| `review-after` | Next review date as `YYYY-MM-DD`, or blank |
| `source` | Lecture, text, problem sheet, URL, or an honest note that the source is unknown |
| `visibility` | Optional publication classification: `private`, `public-framework`, `public-original`, or `public-open-licensed` |
| `source-risk` | Optional provenance risk: `lecture-derived`, `problem-sheet-derived`, `exam-derived`, `lms-derived`, `open-licensed`, `original`, or `unknown` |

Lists use the simple inline form `[first-id, second-id]`. This constrained frontmatter format keeps the scripts dependency-free and the files easy to inspect.

## Status and Review Workflow

Use status as a judgment about recall, not note polish:

- `new`: captured but not learned
- `learning`: partly understood; cannot yet reproduce reliably
- `shaky`: previously learned but errors or gaps remain
- `solid`: can explain and solve representative problems
- `mastered`: reliable after repeated delayed review
- `reference`: useful navigation material, not a review item
- `archived`: retained but excluded from active review

After an active review:

1. Update `last-reviewed`.
2. Set `review-after` to the next useful date. A practical starting cadence is 1–3 days for `new`/`shaky`, 7–14 days for `learning`, 30 days for `solid`, and 60–90 days for `mastered`.
3. Propose a `status` change separately from making it. Upgrade only after repeated recall or application evidence; downgrade when repeated mistakes demonstrate a real gap.
4. Record any evidenced error with the structured Mistake Log convention below.
5. Regenerate `manifest.json` and `REVIEW_QUEUE.md`.

Use `prompts/update-status.md` after a quiz, problem sheet, or timed recall session. One good answer, confidence alone, or improved prose is not enough to upgrade status. A useful upgrade normally needs successful evidence from at least two attempts separated by time or using different task types.

## Recording Mistakes

Mistakes are immutable evidence, not a to-do list. Add one five-field block under `## Mistake Log` only when an actual quiz, problem sheet, exam, or recall attempt exposed the error:

```md
- date: 2026-06-30
  source: problem-sheet-01
  mistake: Describe what went wrong.
  correction: Record the action or idea to apply next time.
  tags: [exam-trap, procedure]
```

Use one line per field and inline slug-style tags. `date: unknown` is allowed only when migrating a genuine older mistake whose date was never recorded. Do not delete old entries when they improve; their recent-priority effect expires automatically after 30 days, while the history remains useful.

## Practice Questions

Every concept note has `## Practice Questions` with `### Easy`, `### Medium`, and `### Exam-style` groups. Questions are ordinary Markdown bullets. Empty groups use `_No practice questions recorded yet._`; never create filler questions merely to satisfy validation.

The manifest records counts by difficulty plus `has-practice-questions`. It also records whether the note has a substantive worked example, allowing weekly review to expose thin notes.

## Review Priority

The generated queue documents the same additive formula beside its results:

- status: shaky +40, new +32, learning +26, solid +8, mastered +0;
- exam weight: high +25, medium +14, low +5, none +0;
- review timing: +30 when due, plus up to +30 for overdue days; missing `review-after` +10;
- review age: never reviewed +20, otherwise up to +20 after the first seven days;
- mistakes: +5 each up to +20, plus +12 for each dated mistake in the last 30 days up to +36;
- missing practice questions on a concept: +10;
- high exam weight combined with shaky status: +15.

The score ranks attention; it is not a grade or automatic status decision. Use `python3 build_review_queue.py --today YYYY-MM-DD` for a reproducible queue on a specified date.

## Manifest-First LLM Use

`manifest.json` contains metadata, publication classifications, short summaries, headings, mistake counts/dates/tags, worked-example coverage, and practice-question counts for every study document. An LLM should:

1. Read the manifest first.
2. Filter to relevant course, topic, type, status, aliases, or exam weight.
3. Open only the selected files listed in `file`.
4. Follow prerequisite and related IDs only when needed.
5. Treat the Markdown notes as authoritative and generated files as disposable indexes.

See [LLM_GUIDE.md](LLM_GUIDE.md) for the full protocol and [prompts/README.md](prompts/README.md) for ready-to-use study workflows.

## LLM Workflow Reference

| Workflow | Prompt |
|---|---|
| Import a rough lecture safely | [prompts/import-lecture.md](prompts/import-lecture.md) |
| Run today's study session | [prompts/daily-study.md](prompts/daily-study.md) |
| Quiz one topic interactively | [prompts/quiz-me.md](prompts/quiz-me.md) |
| Explain a selected concept | [prompts/explain-a-concept.md](prompts/explain-a-concept.md) |
| Improve or extract a durable note | [prompts/improve-this-note.md](prompts/improve-this-note.md) |
| Generate source-backed flashcards | [prompts/generate-flashcards.md](prompts/generate-flashcards.md) |
| Prepare for an exam | [prompts/prepare-for-an-exam.md](prompts/prepare-for-an-exam.md) |
| Plan the next week | [prompts/weekly-review.md](prompts/weekly-review.md) |
| Evaluate a status change from evidence | [prompts/update-status.md](prompts/update-status.md) |

Every workflow must distinguish repository evidence from external explanation, preserve uncertainty, and avoid inventing course content.

## Validation and Generated Files

`validate_notes.py` catches missing fields, malformed dates/lists, malformed structured mistakes, invalid status/weight/visibility/source-risk values, duplicate IDs, broken ID and Markdown links, absolute machine-specific links anywhere in repository Markdown, type/course-directory mismatches, title mismatches, and missing concept sections such as Practice Questions. Errors name the affected file and field or section, show the bad value when useful, and suggest a repair. The command exits non-zero on errors.

`python3 validate_notes.py --public-release` (or `make validate-public`) is the validation component of the canonical `make public-safety` gate. It fails on private visibility, course-derived or unknown source risk, missing publication classifications, and local paths. Do not weaken this check to make a real private repository pass.

`build_manifest.py` and `build_review_queue.py` validate before writing. They will not replace their outputs when notes are malformed. `manifest.json` carries a top-level `_generated` warning; `REVIEW_QUEUE.md` begins with a generated-file HTML comment. Never edit either file manually: change the source Markdown and rebuild it.
